            SAVE OUR HOMELESS ANIMALS

            <p>
            PAWS has adopted a few colonies to improve the condition of homeless animals in its locality. It does so with the active support of the Resident Welfare Associations [RWA’s]. Residents are encouraged to adopt a homeless animal outside their house and take on the responsibility of getting it treated, vaccinated, and sterilized at the center at low cost. Apart from this residents are also advised to feed the homeless animals at a fixed place, away from their own or other peoples homes, as this will reduce incidence of dog bites. Sometimes dogs that are fed right outside the house can become aggressive towards passersby as they start guarding their feeding area.

WHAT WE CAN DO TO SAVE OUR HOMELESS ANIMALS →

When you see a dog being hit or stoned, be sure to inform the offender of the law and get him or her to stop. Should the abuse persist, register an FIR at the closest police station.

It is illegal for anybody to round up homeless animals and abandon them in circumstances likely to cause their death from starvation and thirst. Therefore you should challenge this cruelty in court.

When you see an animal knocked over by a vehicle, get the number of the vehicle. Check the animal for signs of life. If possible, move him or her to safety and administer life-saving first –aid. Call a vet or an animal welfare organization that has an ambulance.
