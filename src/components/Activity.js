            The PAWS team organizes regular Pup Adoption and Anti Rabies Camps on weekends at different localities in and around Delhi. Volunteers work tirelessly to see that these cute, adorable, homeless puppies find good homes.

Free Pup Adoption Programme at the first ever International Pet Fair in India at Okhla, New Delhi on 9th and 10th February. The fair, attended by more than 10,000 people, was inaugrated by ex-chief election commissioner of India, Mr. S.S Gill. At the PAWS stall, apart from the awareness campaign, 19 homeless puppies were adopted.

On 21st February the government of Delhi launched oral rabies vaccine by Virbac company in association with Animal Welfare Board of, India (AWBI). The shelter was visited by people from WHO (World Health Organisation), Chairman AWBI Maj.Gen.(retd.)Dr. R.M.Kharb and many delegates from France. They personally fed Oral Rabies Vaccine to the shelter animals and appreciated the work being done at the shelter. The animals on the streets of Masudpur, Kishangarh and Vasant Kunj were also administered the Oral Rabies Vaccine by WHO.

Our ABC (Animal Birth Control) and Immunization Program is implemented 24/7 round the year with aid from Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). Apart from the homeless animals picked up by PAWS, now on a cost to cost basis, MCD also brings in animals to the shelter for sterilization and vaccination. So far more than 9000 dogs have been sterilized and vaccinated under this program, thereby reducing their population on the roads.

In the last two months, more than 200 dogs are treated at PAWS IPD and released in their respective territories once they recover.
